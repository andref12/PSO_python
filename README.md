# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) - Basic Implementation

This repository contains a basic implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in Python. PSO is a computational method used for optimization problems, inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python instaled (>=3.6). You may need the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pygame
```

## Usage
Run the script with:
```bash
python main.py
```
By default, the implementation optimizes a sample function, but you can modify it to suit your needs.

## Customization
- Change the objective function in the code to optimize a different function.
- Adjust hyperparameters such as the number of particles, inertia weight, and acceleration coefficients.
